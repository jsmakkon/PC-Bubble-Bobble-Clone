# PC_Bubble_Bobble

This game was a school project I re-created myself in 2011 to learn all the parts of this project.

The game is a bubble bobble clone. The project has the basic movement mechanics only, so no menus or other UI are created. There also is no jumping on the bubbles or any powerups and the game has test map only.

For graphics, this project uses Allegro libraries.

Controls:
- W,A,S,D: Movement
- Space: Shoot bubbles
