# PC_Bubble_Bobble

This game was a school project I re-created in 2011 to learn all the parts of this project.

The game is a bubble bobble clone. The project is has the basic movement mechanics only, so no menus or other UI are created. There also is no jumping on the bubbles or any powerups. Also only one test map was created.

For graphics, this project uses Allegro libraries.

Controls:
- W,A,S,D: Movement
- Space: Shoot bubbles
